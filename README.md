# Workout-Selector
A simple script to randomly select a daily workout for myself from a pre-defined list of workouts based on the day of the week. The day of the week determines what type of workout will be selected.

Just a simple fun side project for myself. Planning on coming back to this and adding a GUI to make workout selection simpler and more user friendly.
